DicomComparator is a Perl script to check if two DICOM files are identical or DICOM files under two folders are identical and then save the differences to a file or show the differences to the standard output device.
DicomComparator uses the DicomPack perl package (https://metacpan.org/dist/DicomPack) to process DICOM files.
In addition to the source codes of DicomComparator, an executable version for Windows compiled by Strawberry Perl is also provided here.
